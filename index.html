      <p>Hey there! If you didn't gather from the title and header, my name is Levi Mason, and I'm based out of Oklahoma City, OK. I'm a ramen and Wes Anderson enthusiast who spends countless hours staring at my phone and computer screens. When I'm not working on random projects, you can find me making a cup, or three, of oolong. I enjoy taking "artsy" photos, but can't stand to have my photo taken.</p>

      <h2>about me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I'm currently a student going through the Thinkful Immersive Engineering Prep Course. In college I got my degree in music business and through the years I've been introduced to and worked with the likes of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Flaming Lips</li>
          <li>Steppenwolf</li>
          <li>Grand Funk Railroad</li>
          <li>Brothers Griiin</li>
          <li>colourmusic</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Over the years, I've worked with young artists doing website design and development, helping them craft their image online. This is what sparked my passion for development and lead me to enroll with Thinkful.</p>
