            I'm a recent graduate from the Thinkful Engineering Immersion Course
            where I learned fullstack development using the PERN stack. In
            college I got my degree in music business.

            Over the years, I've worked with young artists doing website design
            and development, helping them craft their image online. This is what
            sparked my passion for development and lead me to enroll with
            Thinkful. Being at Thinkful has led me to want to work with a team
            of experienced and creative programmers.
